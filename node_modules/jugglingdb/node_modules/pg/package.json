  "readme": "#node-postgres\n\nNon-blocking PostgreSQL client for node.js.  Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.  Active development,  well tested, and production use.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install pg\n    \n## Examples\n\n### Simple, using built-in client pool\n\n    var pg = require('pg'); \n    //or native libpq bindings\n    //var pg = require('pg').native\n\n    var conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\n    //error handling omitted\n    pg.connect(conString, function(err, client) {\n      client.query(\"SELECT NOW() as when\", function(err, result) {\n        console.log(\"Row count: %d\",result.rows.length);  // 1\n        console.log(\"Current year: %d\", result.rows[0].when.getYear());\n      });\n    });\n\n### Evented api\n\n    var pg = require('pg'); //native libpq bindings = `var pg = require('pg').native`\n    var conString = \"tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n    \n    var client = new pg.Client(conString);\n    client.connect();\n\n    //queries are queued and executed one after another once the connection becomes available\n    client.query(\"CREATE TEMP TABLE beatles(name varchar(10), height integer, birthday timestamptz)\");\n    client.query(\"INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)\", ['Ringo', 67, new Date(1945, 11, 2)]);\n    client.query(\"INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)\", ['John', 68, new Date(1944, 10, 13)]);\n\n    //queries can be executed either via text/parameter values passed as individual arguments\n    //or by passing an options object containing text, (optional) parameter values, and (optional) query name\n    client.query({\n      name: 'insert beatle',\n      text: \"INSERT INTO beatles(name, height, birthday) values($1, $2, $3)\",\n      values: ['George', 70, new Date(1946, 02, 14)]\n    });\n\n    //subsequent queries with the same name will be executed without re-parsing the query plan by postgres\n    client.query({\n      name: 'insert beatle',\n      values: ['Paul', 63, new Date(1945, 04, 03)]\n    });\n    var query = client.query(\"SELECT * FROM beatles WHERE name = $1\", ['John']);\n\n    //can stream row results back 1 at a time\n    query.on('row', function(row) {\n      console.log(row);\n      console.log(\"Beatle name: %s\", row.name); //Beatle name: John\n      console.log(\"Beatle birth year: %d\", row.birthday.getYear()); //dates are returned as javascript dates\n      console.log(\"Beatle height: %d' %d\\\"\", Math.floor(row.height/12), row.height%12); //integers are returned as javascript ints\n    });\n    \n    //fired after last row is emitted\n    query.on('end', function() { \n      client.end();\n    });\n\n### Example notes\n\nnode-postgres supports both an 'event emitter' style API and a 'callback' style.  The callback style is more concise and generally preferred, but the evented API can come in handy.  They can be mixed and matched.  The only events which do __not__ fire when callbacks are supplied are the `error` events, as they are to be handled by the callback function.\n\nAll examples will work with the pure javascript bindings (currently default) or the libpq native (c/c++) bindings (currently in beta)\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n### Info\n\n* pure javascript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* _heavily_ tested\n  * the same suite of 200+ integration tests passed by both javascript & libpq bindings\n  * benchmark & long-running memory leak tests performed before releases\n  * tested with with\n    * postgres 8.x, 9.x\n    * Linux, OS X\n    * node 2.x & 4.x\n* row-by-row result streaming\n* built-in (optional) connection pooling\n* responsive project maintainer\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications\n  * extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion \n* query queue\n* active development\n* fast\n* close mirror of the node-mysql api for future multi-database-supported ORM implementation ease\n\n### Contributors\n\nMany thanks to the following:\n\n* [creationix](https://github.com/creationix)\n* [felixge](https://github.com/felixge)\n* [pshc](https://github.com/pshc)\n* [pjornblomqvist](https://github.com/bjornblomqvist)\n* [JulianBirch](https://github.com/JulianBirch)\n* [ef4](https://github.com/ef4)\n* [napa3um](https://github.com/napa3um)\n* [drdaeman](https://github.com/drdaeman)\n* [booo](https://github.com/booo)\n* [neonstalwart](https://github.com/neonstalwart)\n* [homme](https://github.com/homme)\n* [bdunavant](https://github.com/bdunavant)\n* [tokumine](https://github.com/tokumine)\n* [shtylman](https://github.com/shtylman)\n* [cricri](https://github.com/cricri)\n* [AlexanderS](https://github.com/AlexanderS)\n* [ahtih](https://github.com/ahtih)\n* [chowey](https://github.com/chowey)\n* [kennym](https://github.com/kennym)\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n### __PLEASE__ check out the WIKI\n\nIf you have a question, post it to the FAQ section of the WIKI so everyone can read the answer\n\n## Production Use\n* [yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com)\n* [bayt.com](http://bayt.com)\n* [bitfloor.com](https://bitfloor.com)\n\n_if you use node-postgres in production and would like your site listed here, fork & add it_\n\n## Help\n\nIf you need help or run into _any_ issues getting node-postgres to work on your system please report a bug or contact me directly.
